# freeCodeCamp - Scientific Computing with Python Learning Path

This repository archives my work on the guided projects and exercises from the freeCodeCamp "Scientific Computing with Python" curriculum. These projects were completed as part of the learning process leading up to the final certification projects.

Each folder in this repository represents a self-contained project or concept, demonstrating the application of fundamental and advanced Python principles.

## Completed Projects & Exercises

Here is a list of the projects currently included in this repository:

*   **Vigen√®re Cipher:** An implementation of the classic polyalphabetic substitution cipher, focusing on string manipulation and modular arithmetic.
*   **Expense Tracker:** A simple command-line application to track and filter personal expenses, demonstrating data structures and user input handling.
*   **Square Root (Bisection Method):** A function to find the square root of a number using the bisection numerical method, highlighting algorithmic thinking.
*   **Luhn Algorithm:** An implementation of the checksum formula used to validate identification numbers like credit card numbers.
*   **Case Converter:** A script to convert strings between different programming case styles (e.g., snake_case, PascalCase).

*(This list will be updated as I complete more exercises in the curriculum.)*
