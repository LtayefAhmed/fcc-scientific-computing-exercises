# freeCodeCamp - Scientific Computing with Python Learning Path

This repository archives my work on the guided projects and exercises from the freeCodeCamp "Scientific Computing with Python" curriculum. These projects were completed as part of the learning process leading up to the final certification projects.

Each folder in this repository represents a self-contained project or concept, demonstrating the application of fundamental and advanced Python principles.

## Completed Projects & Exercises

Here is a list of the projects currently included in this repository:

*   **Vigenère Cipher:** An implementation of the classic polyalphabetic substitution cipher, focusing on string manipulation and modular arithmetic.
*   **Expense Tracker:** A simple command-line application to track and filter personal expenses, demonstrating data structures and user input handling.
*   **Square Root (Bisection Method):** A function to find the square root of a number using the bisection numerical method, highlighting algorithmic thinking.
*   **Luhn Algorithm:** An implementation of the checksum formula used to validate identification numbers like credit card numbers.
*   **Case Converter:** A script to convert strings between different programming case styles (e.g., snake_case, PascalCase).
*   **Password Generator:** A robust script for creating cryptographically strong, random passwords. It leverages Python's `secrets` module for security and the `re` module to enforce customizable constraints, such as minimum length and required counts of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
*   **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm:** An implementation of the classic Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. This project demonstrates the use of data structures like dictionaries and lists to manage distances and paths, and algorithmic concepts such as greedy approaches by iteratively selecting the node with the minimum distance.



*(This list will be updated as I complete more exercises in the curriculum.)*

You can find the five final, graded projects for my certification in their own dedicated repositories on my GitHub profile.
